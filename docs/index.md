# Overview

This project originated through a collaboration with CSS Automation members to build an ‘Automation+in+a+box’ solution to be used as a base architecture for Automation use cases. In 2022, it was selected as part of the CX EMEA 'Communities of Practice' initiative. Currently the solution automatically builds a variety of components which is then used to adress multiple use cases.

 Components:

+ Jenkins
+ Gitlab
+ Ansible
+ Terraform
+ Webex Bot (Flask based)
+ TIG (Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana)

 Use Cases:

+ DNAC Custom Reporting
+ CI/CD – [ DNAC, VMware and ACI.]
+ Webex Chat bot
+ (Future) Automated Testing
+ (Future) Network Visibility

## Scope

We have an accelerated demand from our customers to rapidly deliver automation use cases, with multivendor technologies to ensure our solutions meet +their+ needs. To fulfill this we need modular frameworks to run automation use cases on our laptops or in development environments.

+ Business Case
  + We need to make educating/advising customers simple, efficient and low cost.
  + We need to enable technical staff to upskill with *modern* automation techniques.
+ CX Issues
  + There are currently limited labs available for Automation use cases.
  + CSS are assessed on utilization or case metrics with time limitations on activities.
+ Customer Issues
  + Often require advice on a range of topics including Automation strategy as well as specific implementations.
  + Pressured to deliver value with multi+faceted requirements and specific constraints.
+ Solution
  + Produce a basic framework to address the majority of these challenges.
  + Prioritise extensibility to simplify developing use cases in a standardised way with a singular platform.
  + Build in a modular way with reduced performance requirements that can be run on a laptop or other lower performance platforms.
